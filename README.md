This is a web scraping/data analysis project on the Mosconi Cup data from 1998 to 2016.

The Mosconi Cup is an annual event in the game of pocket billiards whereby the best players in America face off against the best players in Europe. Over time, the game of pool has lost a lot of its prowess and, as such, it is hard to find good statistical information on the players' past performances throughout the years. This project is an attempt to remedy that by providing the fans with interesting and useful stats regarding the players' past performances in the sport's most entertaining annual tournament.
